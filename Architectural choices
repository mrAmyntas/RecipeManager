I decided to store recipes in a textfile. Easy to read/write/parse and no need to setup caching or a database for this simple app.

I made one frame and four panels which each have their own components. With a FlowLayout these could be set in the right place, and
by locking the windows size it will always look the same. 

I made an interface (PanelObserver) and a 'mediator' class (PanelMediator) to have changes in one panel (e.g. button click) call 
an update in other panels (e.g. filter certain recipes). 

I put files in one package to keep it simple.

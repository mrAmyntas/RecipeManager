I decided to store recipes in a textfile. Easy to read/write/parse and no need to setup caching or a database for this simple app.

I made one frame and four panels which each have their own components. With a FlowLayout these could be set in the right place, and
by locking the windows size it will always look the same. 

I made an interface (PanelObserver) and a 'mediator' class (PanelMediator) to have changes in one panel (e.g. button click) call 
an update in other panels (e.g. filter certain recipes). 

I put files in one package to keep it simple.

The main method is in RecipeManager.java, which first reads the Recipes text file to parse existing recipes in a hashmap.
Then a GUI is made, existing of just one frame (MyFrame.java). The frame adds four panels as components;
RecipeFilterPanel, the top panel where the filter options are set.
RecipeControlPanel, where the three buttons are set which can add/remove/update recipes.
RecipeListPanel, where all the recipes are listed as clickable buttons.
RecipeTextPanel, where the last selected recipe's contents are displayed and can be copied by user.
The hashmap uses the recipe title as key, and an object of class RecipeData to store all of its required information as value.
